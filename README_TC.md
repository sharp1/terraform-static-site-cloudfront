As the cloud engineer, you will deploy the clients Next.js portfolio website on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles with Terraform.
The cliet needs this website hosted on a robust, scalable, and cost-effective platform with global availability and fast loading times.

Requirements
The website must be:

Highly Available: Accessible worldwide with minimal downtime
Scalable: Able to handle increasing traffic without performance degradation
Cost-Effective: Optimized hosting costs without unnecessary expenses
Fast Loading: Quick loading times for all visitors globally


Project Objectives

By completing this project, you will:
Deploy a Next.js website on AWS
Implement Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
Configure global content delivery with AWS CloudFront
Apply security and performance best practices
Host all project files and code on GitHub

Terry Cundiff, Cloud Security Engineer, what I need to do:

Host a static Next.js site on AWS.
Make it secure by default:
Private S3 bucket
Only CloudFront can read it via OAI
HTTPS to users
Encryption + blocked public access
Manage it via Terraform so it’s repeatable / versioned
